<b>Dark matter and DarkHistory</b>
<br>
<p>
Dark matter processes, such as decay or annihilation, can inject a significant amount of energy into the early universe, producing observable changes in the temperature and ionization histories. These changes can alter observables such as the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background and the temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We are using measurements of the IGM temperature derived from Lyman-alpha flux power spectra to constrain p-wave annihilating and decaying dark matter using the

<b>Gravitational waves and starlight</b>

When gravitational waves interact with the light from stars, they can cause the time of the light's arrival to change, which is what pulsar timing arrays seek to measure, as well as deflect the light's trajectory, which manifests in astrometry as a fluctuation in the apparent positions of stars. Drawing an analogy to how one derives the statistics of cosmic microwave background polarization, I showed how one can construct the auto-correlations and cross-correlations of these observables. It is also possible to constrain the polarization content of gravitational waves by predicting the form of the power spectra and correlations for each polarization. I demonstrated that these can be calculated with relative ease using total-angular-momentum waves, which provide an alternative to the plane wave basis that simplifies calculations on the sphere of the sky. Currently, I am thinking about how to extend this work to theories of massive gravity, i.e. gravitational waves that do not propagate at the speed of light.

<b>Mira variables as distance indicators</b>
<br>
<p>
<img src="./period-luminosity.png" height="220" width="360" align="right" hspace="10"/>
Mira variables are useful distance indicators, due to their high luminosities and well-defined period-luminosity relation. Using SAAO and MACHO observations, I measured a distance to the Galactic center of 7.9 +- 0.3 kpc, which is in good agreement with other values. I also used theoretical models of Miras to examine the dependence of the period-luminosity relation on age, metallicity, and helium abundance. Assuming that the models we use are valid for Galactic Miras, we find that there is a non-negligible dependence on metallicity and helium, with a smaller effect from stellar age. Thus, as we strive to use Mira variables to make increasingly precise distance estimates, both within and outside of the Galaxy, accurately determining the variation of the period-luminosity relations from galaxy to galaxy will become more important.
